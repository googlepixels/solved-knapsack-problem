Given n items of known weights **w**â‚, …,**w**n and values **v**â‚, …, **v**n anda knapsack of capacity **W**, find the most valuable subset of the items that fit into the knapsack.

– Implement the recursive algorithm to solve the knapsack problem discussed in class.

– Approximate its time complexity utilizing the heuristic method.

– Can you determine its time complexity with another method?
